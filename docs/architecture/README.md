# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive architecture documentation for the multi-service platform.

## Documents

- [System Overview](./system-overview.md) - High-level system architecture and design principles
- [Service Architecture](./service-architecture.md) - Detailed service design and interactions
- [Data Architecture](./data-architecture.md) - Database design and data flow patterns
- [Security Architecture](./security-architecture.md) - Security design and implementation
- [Deployment Architecture](./deployment-architecture.md) - Infrastructure and deployment patterns
- [Integration Patterns](./integration-patterns.md) - Inter-service communication patterns
- [Scalability Design](./scalability-design.md) - Scaling strategies and performance optimization

## Diagrams

All architecture diagrams are created using Mermaid syntax and can be viewed in:
- GitHub (native Mermaid support)
- Mermaid Live Editor (https://mermaid.live/)
- VS Code with Mermaid extension
- Documentation sites that support Mermaid

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Microservices Architecture
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Each service owns its domain and data
- **Service Independence**: Services can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently
- **API-First**: All services expose well-defined APIs
- **Database per Service**: Each service has its own database

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Services communicate via events for loose coupling
- **Event Sourcing**: Critical business events are stored for audit and replay
- **Saga Pattern**: Distributed transactions managed through choreographed events

### 3. Cloud-Native Design
- **Containerization**: All services run in Docker containers
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for container orchestration
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and tracing
- **Resilience**: Circuit breakers, retries, and graceful degradation

### 4. Security by Design
- **Zero Trust**: No implicit trust between services
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions for all components
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit

### 5. Developer Experience
- **Documentation First**: Comprehensive documentation for all APIs and processes
- **Testing Strategy**: Automated testing at all levels
- **CI/CD**: Automated build, test, and deployment pipelines
- **Local Development**: Easy local setup and development environment

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Frameworks**: Express.js, Fastify
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ
- **API Gateway**: Kong, Nginx

### Infrastructure
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Service Mesh**: Istio (optional)
- **Load Balancing**: Nginx, HAProxy
- **CDN**: CloudFlare, AWS CloudFront

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Metrics**: Prometheus + Grafana
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- **Tracing**: Jaeger, Zipkin
- **APM**: New Relic, DataDog (optional)

### Development & Deployment
- **Version Control**: Git
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI
- **Package Management**: pnpm (monorepo)
- **Testing**: Jest, Supertest, Playwright
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, SonarQube

## Getting Started

1. **Understanding the System**: Start with [System Overview](./system-overview.md)
2. **Service Details**: Review [Service Architecture](./service-architecture.md)
3. **Data Flow**: Understand [Data Architecture](./data-architecture.md)
4. **Security Model**: Review [Security Architecture](./security-architecture.md)
5. **Deployment**: Check [Deployment Architecture](./deployment-architecture.md)

## Contributing to Architecture

When making architectural changes:

1. **Document First**: Update architecture documents before implementation
2. **Review Process**: All architectural changes require team review
3. **Impact Analysis**: Consider impact on all services and systems
4. **Migration Plan**: Provide clear migration path for breaking changes
5. **Testing**: Ensure comprehensive testing of architectural changes

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Major architectural decisions are documented in the [ADR directory](./adr/). Each ADR includes:
- Context and problem statement
- Considered options
- Decision and rationale
- Consequences and trade-offs
