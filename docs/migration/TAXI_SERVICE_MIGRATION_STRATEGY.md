# Taxi Service Migration Strategy

## Overview

The existing `giga_taxi_main` and `giga_taxi_driver` services will be **consolidated and replaced** by the new unified `services/taxi-service`. This migration follows the microservices architecture overhaul requirements to create a more maintainable, scalable, and feature-rich taxi service.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Services
1. **`giga_taxi_main`** - Customer-facing taxi service
   - Handles ride requests from customers
   - Manages customer profiles and ride history
   - Processes payments and ratings

2. **`giga_taxi_driver`** - Driver-facing taxi service  
   - Handles driver registration and management
   - Manages driver availability and location
   - Processes ride acceptance and completion

### Issues with Current Architecture
- **Service Duplication**: Two separate services with overlapping functionality
- **Data Inconsistency**: Separate databases leading to sync issues
- **Complex Communication**: Inter-service communication between main and driver services
- **Limited Scalability**: Monolithic structure within each service
- **Outdated Technology**: Using older patterns and dependencies

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: New Service Deployment (‚úÖ COMPLETED)
- [x] Deploy new unified `services/taxi-service` with modern architecture
- [x] Implement PostgreSQL database with PostGIS spatial support
- [x] Create comprehensive API endpoints for both drivers and customers
- [x] Add real-time WebSocket communication
- [x] Implement proper authentication and authorization

### Phase 2: Data Migration (NEXT STEPS)
1. **Database Migration**
   ```sql
   -- Migrate driver data from giga_taxi_driver MongoDB to PostgreSQL
   INSERT INTO drivers (user_id, first_name, last_name, email, phone_number, ...)
   SELECT user, firstName, lastName, email, phoneNumber, ... FROM old_driver_collection;
   
   -- Migrate customer data from giga_taxi_main MongoDB to PostgreSQL  
   INSERT INTO customers (user_id, phone_number, payment_method, ...)
   SELECT user, phoneNumber, paymentMethod, ... FROM old_customer_collection;
   
   -- Migrate ride history
   INSERT INTO rides (customer_id, driver_id, status, pickup_location, ...)
   SELECT customerId, driverId, status, pickupLocation, ... FROM old_rides_collection;
   ```

2. **Data Transformation**
   - Convert MongoDB documents to PostgreSQL relational structure
   - Transform location data to PostGIS POINT geometry
   - Migrate ride history with proper status mapping
   - Convert vehicle information to new schema

### Phase 3: API Migration (NEXT STEPS)
1. **Update Client Applications**
   - Mobile apps (customer and driver)
   - Web applications
   - Admin dashboards

2. **API Endpoint Mapping**
   ```
   OLD giga_taxi_main endpoints ‚Üí NEW taxi-service endpoints
   POST /ride/request ‚Üí POST /api/rides/request
   GET /ride/history ‚Üí GET /api/rides/customer/:customerId
   POST /taxi/create ‚Üí POST /api/customers/register
   
   OLD giga_taxi_driver endpoints ‚Üí NEW taxi-service endpoints  
   POST /driver/create ‚Üí POST /api/drivers/register
   PUT /driver/location ‚Üí PUT /api/drivers/:driverId/location
   POST /ride/accept ‚Üí POST /api/rides/accept
   ```

3. **WebSocket Migration**
   - Replace existing event system with Socket.IO
   - Migrate real-time location tracking
   - Update ride status notifications

### Phase 4: Service Decommissioning (FINAL STEP)
1. **Gradual Traffic Migration**
   - Use API Gateway to route traffic to new service
   - Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
   - Monitor performance and error rates

2. **Legacy Service Shutdown**
   - Stop accepting new requests to old services
   - Complete pending rides in old system
   - Archive historical data
   - Decommission `giga_taxi_main` and `giga_taxi_driver`

## Benefits of Migration

### üèóÔ∏è **Architectural Improvements**
