## General Incident Response Process

### 1. Acknowledge and Assess (0-5 minutes)
1. Acknowledge the alert in PagerDuty/Slack
2. Check the alert details and runbook link
3. Assess the severity and impact
4. Start incident response if needed

### 2. Initial Response (5-15 minutes)
1. Follow the specific runbook for the alert
2. Gather initial information and logs
3. Implement immediate mitigation if possible
4. Escalate if needed based on severity

### 3. Investigation and Resolution (15+ minutes)
1. Deep dive into root cause analysis
2. Implement permanent fix
3. Monitor for resolution
4. Document findings and actions taken

### 4. Post-Incident (After resolution)
1. Update incident status
2. Conduct post-mortem if needed
3. Update runbooks based on learnings
4. Implement preventive measures
