- `GET /notifications` - Get vendor notifications
- `PATCH /notifications/:id/read` - Mark notification as read

### Admin Endpoints (`/api/admin`)
- `GET /vendors` - Search vendors
- `GET /vendors/:id` - Get vendor details
- `POST /vendors/:id/approve` - Approve vendor
- `POST /vendors/:id/reject` - Reject vendor

## Authentication & Authorization

### Vendor Routes
- Require JWT authentication
- Vendor-specific operations check vendor ownership

### Admin Routes
- Require JWT authentication
- Require admin role
- Full vendor management capabilities

## Data Validation

All endpoints use Zod schemas for request validation:
- `CreateVendorSchema` - Vendor registration
- `UpdateVendorSchema` - Profile updates
- `ProductApprovalRequestSchema` - Product submissions
- `VendorSearchQuerySchema` - Search parameters
- And more...

## Business Logic

### Vendor Registration Flow
1. User submits vendor application
2. System creates vendor record with 'pending' status
3. Admin reviews and approves/rejects
4. Vendor receives notification of decision
5. Approved vendors can start listing products

### Product Approval Flow
1. Vendor submits product for approval
2. Product enters 'pending' approval status
3. Admin reviews product data
4. Admin can approve, reject, or request changes
5. Vendor receives notification of decision
6. Approved products become active

### Payout Processing
1. Admin initiates payout for date range
2. System calculates gross sales and commission
3. Net amount calculated (gross - commission)
4. Payout record created
5. Vendor receives notification
6. Integration with payment service for actual transfer

## Analytics and Reporting

### Vendor Dashboard Stats
- Total sales and orders
- Product counts (total, active, pending)
- Average rating and review count
- Pending payouts
- Growth metrics (30-day comparison)

### Sales Reports
- Date range filtering
- Top products by revenue
- Daily sales breakdown
- Order and item counts
- Average order value

## Integration Points

### Authentication Service
- JWT token validation
- User role verification
- User ID references

### Payment Service
- Payout processing
- Commission calculations
- Payment method validation

### Notification Service
- Email notifications for status changes
- SMS notifications for important events
- Push notifications for mobile apps

## Security Features

- Role-based access control
- Vendor data isolation
- Encrypted banking information
- Audit trails for all admin actions
- Input validation and sanitization

## Performance Optimizations

- Database indexing on frequently queried fields
- Pagination for large result sets
- Efficient aggregation queries for analytics
- Connection pooling for database operations

## Error Handling

- Comprehensive error messages
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Validation error details
- Graceful failure handling

## Testing

- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Validation schema tests
- Database operation tests

## Future Enhancements

- Multi-language support for vendor interface
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Automated payout scheduling
- Vendor performance scoring
- Integration with external accounting systems
- Mobile vendor app support

## Configuration

Environment variables required:
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `JWT_SECRET` - JWT signing secret
- `PAYMENT_SERVICE_URL` - Payment service endpoint

## Deployment

The vendor management system is integrated into the main ecommerce service and deploys as part of the monolithic application. Future iterations may extract this into a separate microservice.
